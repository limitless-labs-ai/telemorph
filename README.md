- Configure site name, URL, and social media handles

### Footer (`footer.ts`)

- Define company information and links

### Features (`feature.ts`)

- Manages the features section content
- Configure feature cards and layout

### Hero Section (`hero.tsx`)

- Controls the hero section content
- Configure headlines and call-to-action buttons

## Customization

1. **Styling**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` to customize the design system
2. **Components**: Edit components in `src/components` directory
3. **Configuration**: Update files in `src/config` to modify content and layout
4. **Pages**: Add or modify pages in `src/app` directory

# Job Listings Management

This directory contains the job listings for the careers page. Each job is stored as a Markdown file with frontmatter metadata.

## Adding a New Job Listing

To add a new job listing:

1. Create a new Markdown file in this directory with a unique identifier (e.g., `job-004.md`)
2. Include the following frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "Job Title"
department: "Department Name"
location: "Location (e.g., Remote, City, etc.)"
employmentType: "Employment Type (e.g., Full-time, Part-time, Contract)"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---
```

3. Write the job description in Markdown format below the frontmatter. Use headings (# and ##) to organize the content.

Example structure:

```markdown
# Job Title

General introduction and overview of the position.

## Requirements:

- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Responsibilities:

- Responsibility 1
- Responsibility 2
- Responsibility 3

## Benefits:

- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2
- Benefit 3
```

## Updating or Removing a Job Listing

- To update a job listing, edit the corresponding Markdown file.
- To remove a job listing, delete the corresponding Markdown file.

## Important Notes

- New jobs will automatically appear on the careers page after deployment.
- Jobs are sorted by date, with the newest jobs appearing first.
- The job ID used in the URL is derived from the filename (without the `.md` extension).
